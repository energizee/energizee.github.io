            <p>Lex: Shown the skills to fit the implementer role. They have shown great strength and reliability in keeping the team in shape and gave the team a clear goal to aspire for. Managed the bibliography page, ensuring
                the formatting was consistent and the links worked properly. He also managed the deadlines for the team, ensuring they were on track to completing their work on time.<br><br>

                Lee: Shown the skills to fit the Specialist role. Gave the team knowledge in fields they were better spoken in and provided plenty of information for the team to dig into. He was responsible for creating, designing
                and managing the entire website creation process (HTML and CSS). His skills in Javascript were very helpful in ensuring the other webpages were accessible. <br><br>

Douglas: Shown the skills to fit the Monitor Evaluator role. They acted as a barrier in giving approval or disapproval upon certain aspects of the project that the team would present to them. He created the text for this webpage and ensured 
the team understood what they were trying to do, providing useful intel where the team needed it.<br><br>

Nathan: Shown the skills to fit the Co-ordinator role. Capable of drawing the team back onto the task at hand, confidently stated the goals the team had to follow. Nathan reviewed the essays, ensuring they were good enough to
upload to the website, and also wrote the overview for the homepage.<br><br>

Overall, our team worked very well together. The start was very rocky, as we didn't have a clear goal in mind, and didn't know how to work together. We slowly grew to know eachother, and as such, this confusion turned into 
confidence as we grow closer, and near the end of the project, we understood our individual strengths and weaknesses enough so that we can cover areas each of us struggled in.  This website is
the culmination of our joint effort.

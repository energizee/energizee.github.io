            <h3> AI's recent advancements in intelligence and power has really propelled it from a passing thought to a force to be reckoned with, and for good reason; it can do far more than a simple human can and can 
                think up completely unique solutions to existing problem, which sometimes far surpass anything that has come before. 
            </h3>
            <h3 id="quote">'Computer modelling, simulation and machine learning have been incorporated by computer scientists in partnership with environmental scientists to employ an array of information technology
                 tools at their disposal to help fight climate change' (4)</h3>
            <h3>Repeated simulations over thousands of iterations paired with machine learning allows algorithms to best optimize a solution to a problem, such as creating more efficient insulation in a home during
                the colder months, whilst also keeping your home cooler during the summer. This is excellent for communities as it allows for more compact housing, not wasted on heat, and is also excellent for 
                the environment, as excessive heat is reduced, slowing the rapid effects of global warming. 
            </h3>

            <p>. AI can also be incorporated into kitchens, too. Winnow is a great example of this, expanding upon a great innovation that is helpful to a lot of people. By reducing food waste, not only can we 
                reduce environmental impact from food waste, but we can also increase the longevity of our kitchens and the effectiveness of food. This allows us to feed countless more people in 
                our communities, as food would become far more available to those less fortunate that need it.</p>
                <p id ="quote">‘One company that is using AI to reduce waste is Winnow. Winnow has developed an AI-powered system that can help commercial kitchens reduce waste by up to 50%’ (5)</p>
                <p>It doesn't stop there. With AI in other rooms, you can use them to improve quality of living at less cost. For example, using a similar type of AI to reduce water wasted in the bathroom or kitchen, or
                to reduce or change temperatures of specific rooms, depending on if someone is present, or by set parameters.

            <p>Though, computation does not come without its own risks. Even though it has brought many new opportunities and have undeniably made our lives far more comfortable, 
                it is still a double-edged sword, as it requires many resources to create and maintain, for example, <i>‘data centres and data transmission networks are responsible 
                for 1% of global energy related to Greenhouse emissions’ (6)</i>, and that’s just data centres and transmission networks, a small part of our current computational 
                toolbox. There’s also a stigma going around that artificial intelligence may ‘go rogue’ and attempt to kill the entire human species, which brings fear into the 
                hearts of our communities, dividing them and slowing progress into the field of artificial intelligence. </div>

            <p>We need to take steps to make sure that the technology we birthed into this world isn’t the one that will take us out of it. Luckily, humanity thought ahead, and have attempted to minimise the impact of 
                computation on the environment, so that we can still reap the benefits of this new technology with minimal consequences. Both Artificial Intelligence and Smart technology, whilst great, are only a 
                few examples of computation used to help the environment, not hinder it.</p>
            <p>Computation has already incorporated in our daily lives to improve both our lives and the environment, but it does not stop there. With rapid development 
                of artificial intelligence and human understanding of computation rising each year, environmental issues tackled more effectively and 
                in addition, our communities thrive more than ever. A healthy environment means a healthy community, and we need to take steps to ensure
                that the blue ball in space we live on stays blue for the near future.</p>

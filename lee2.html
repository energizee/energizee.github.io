            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <h3>Technology is virtually everywhere in modern security, with most cities almost fully covered by CCTV surveillance, and all digital actions easily tracked down. This is vital for an effective security network for communities as it ensures that no action can go unseen under the scrutiny of investigators and ensures justice for victims of crime.</h3>

            <p>Law enforcement has seen a huge number of technological improvements that have proven very effective in making crime easier to track and easier to prevent. ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras are a prime example of computing scienceâ€™s power in law enforcement. These systems are used in some police vehicles, and automatically scan registration plates and check them against large police databases and will return any important information such as if the vehicle is stolen, if the MOT is expired or if the owner has a warrant out for their arrest. This is extremely useful for law enforcement as these checks are fully automated, and if a plate cannot be read, the system will notify the operator of the problem. This reinforces the harmony between humans and machines, as the system does the checks at speeds that are not possible for humans and relays all important information but will also notify human operators if they are needed.</p>

            <p>Another big aspect regarding law enforcement is CCTV systems. Most cities are widely covered by CCTV cameras, both privately within businesses and publicly on streets. This kind of surveillance is a staple in crime-stopping as it not only can be used as evidence to place a suspect at a crime scene, but the mere presence of a camera can be enough to dissuade people from committing a crime in the first place. Facial recognition systems are even in use in some places, which aids humans in identifying suspects on video and providing information about them. This can save police time and resources, especially considering the large video files produced by CCTV cameras, as it saves humans from having to closely analyse long videos. In a study of 251,195 crimes recorded by British Transport Police that occurred on the British railway network between 2011 and 2015, it was found that CCTV was available to investigators in 45% of cases and its use proved successful in 65% of those cases where it was available. In this case, the CCTV was regarded as useful where it increased the chances of crimes being solved for all crime types except drugs/weapons possession and fraud <i>(Ashby, M.P.J., et al. 2017)(5)</i>. </p>

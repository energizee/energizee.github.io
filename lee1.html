            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <h3>Public safety is a vital aspect of a successful community. The peace of mind brought to civilians through effective public safety measures is invaluable, and these measures are always evolving with the help of computer science. Making sure that civilians are not negatively affected by aspects of modern society that are out of their control is key to a thriving community and infrastructure to ensure this is constantly improving with the forever-expanding possibilities that technology holds. </h3>

            <p>One aspect of public safety that has progressed massively from computer science and will continue to be is road safety. Road accidents are a key problem regarding sustainable cities and communities, as roads are vital for connecting cities and allowing vehicular access to locations within. Information from the World Health Organisation says that road-related incidents cause more than 1.35 million deaths per year, with 93% of them occurring in developing countries <i>(Eskandari Torbaghan et al., 2022)(6)</i>.</p>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <p>Starting with the main aspect of road accidents, the vehicles themselves, a key technological implementation specifically with the goal of providing drivers with information about their surroundings, are sensors that give warnings if an object is dangerously close, with speed as a risk factor. This kind of autonomous warning system helps keep drivers aware of nearby cars with more information considered than what you would get from looking around, ultimately reducing the risk of a collision. These warnings come as both an audible warning (usually a loud beeping noise) and, depending on the vehicle, a visual representation of the sensor data showing where the object is in relation to the vehicle. Features like this are the embodiment of computer scienceâ€™s role in public safety, as it does not act as a replacement for human awareness, it instead acts as additional support that works in harmony with human drivers to maintain the level of awareness needed when driving.</p>

            <p>Outwith the actual vehicles, there are many technological implementations that can be used to keep roads safe in communities. A major one is traffic light systems, in which computer science can be used to make smart traffic lights that adapt to sensory information, making light switching more efficient and streamlining traffic, and also make traffic light systems consider congestion and road accidents, which traditional lights do not do <i>(Ghazal, B. et al., 2016)(7)</i>. Congestion is a big problem in cities that can cause surprisingly large time and financial losses. Research by INRIX in 2018 shows that, in Istanbul and Moscow, the amount of time lost to road congestion for drivers was 210 and 157 hours, respectively. In Boston, congestion resulted in 164 of lost time for drivers, with losses per driver reaching $2,291 and city damages as high as $4.1 billion. <i>(Nur Aulia Yusuf, A. et al., 2020)(8)</i>. With smart traffic lights, it is expected that they can help decrease congestion and make light switching and traffic flow much more efficient compared to the traditional system, which is simply run on a timer, not allowing consideration for any other circumstances.</p>

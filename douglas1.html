        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <h3>- Question: What is social media and how does it relate to sustainable cities and communities?
            <br>
            - Answer: Social media is a way of communicating with others virtually, which introduces the idea of variety
            and
            adaptation to differing environments.
            <br>

            In the current day and age, it is easy to gain access to an electronic device and be exposed to the
            internet. Social
            media is unavoidable nowadays (especially if you live in a developing country) due to people being closer
            with their
            electronic devices. While some may view this to be negatively affecting society, with the help of
            computation it is not
            necessarily a pathogen that is plaguing society as we speak.

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <p>Social media can stimulate community learning and overall enhance the production of communities. Due to the
            uniqueness
            of everyone in a community, it can often be seen as a wonderful way of gaining completely new perspectives
            that an
            individual may have not had isolated. (1) “You can use social media to research, learn, and share best
            practices,
            lessons learned, and innovative solutions from other communities or experts.” 
            This will often build stronger communities with individual or shared
            perspectives;
            this can be weaponised in hopes of creating a brighter future, with more inspiration and ease of access to
            knowledge.
            <br>
            Some may opt to use social media in a way of reaching out to others in hopes of making new companions,
            contacting loved
            ones, learning diverse cultures etc. Humans were not designed to live in isolation and social media is more
            than capable
            of closing that gap with ease. It is not recommended to base your entire persona around social media due to
            it
            potentially having negative effects on individuals, despite that it is effective at connecting people if
            used safely and
            correctly.

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, social media is a fantastic way of exposing yourself to the unknown, but you’d be none
            the wiser to undergo overexposure as: (2) “Many studies reveal that being online for a long period of time
            in an empty space can create a feeling of loneliness since the person’s inner mind gradually develop
            solitude by over exposure to others happy moments.” While developed countries and akin may be fortunate enough to have access to such a powerful tool,
            said tool can also result in great hardships if said person is not careful. Therefore, it is recommended to
            limit yourself to the amount of content you consume on social media in hopes of preventing an event like
            this.

            While social media can be a seen as a fantastic way of growing and forming stable communities it can also be
            disruptive and even be seen as main leading factor to cyberbullying. Many teenagers often find themselves
            missing sleep due to their free usage of social media. While it may not necessarily be fault of social
            media, it can depict it as being very obsessive and disruptive due to this phenomenon being a common
            occurrence. Cyberbullying is not something that would often affect the adult world, depending on how formal
            the setting is of course, but it is common within teenager world. Internet trolls will often demotivate
            people or cause unnecessary conflicts and this can be seen as a disadvantage due to social media giving
            people the power to stay anonymous, allowing for them to be more brutal and harsher.

            <h3>Making a city inclusive, safe, sustainable and resilient highly depends on the jobs of the cities 
                inhabitants. As cities grow more reliant on computer science every day, the demand for software 
                developers will skyrocket in every industry. Computer science will lead societies to a cleaner, safer 
                and much more efficient future. This will be executed in a variety of ways including assisting 
                people in their jobs, making jobs more eco-friendly and producing more job opportunities.

            <p>We are now in a time where most office based companies make use a home and office hybrid work
                system which heavily depends on software and information systems which are easy to access and 
                simple to use. This is highlighted in an investigation conducted by the Office for National Statistics
                which explains that between February 2022 and May 2022 the percentage of hybrid workers
                increased from 13% to 24% showing a continuous growth in the popularity of hybrid working. (1)
                This reinforces the point that there is an ever-growing demand for computer scientists to to constantly
                update and create improved software to allow people to communicate, work and ultimately continue 
                to grow in their own field. In addition to hybrid working, the use of software has been utilised in
                more niche industries including engineering, data analysis, construction and sales management.
                Each industry which incorporates computer science into its business will work far more efficiently
                leading to a more significant contribution to society, in turn, either making 
                society safer, more sustainable or generating more wealth for that city.

                As mentioned previously, the construction industry has greatly benefited from the use of software in
            the workplace. Construction has come a long way from being a strenuous, frustrating and time
            consuming job. With todays rate of population increase, cities cannot wait for months and months
            for architects  and builders to use old fashioned methods to create homes for people- they need
            something simple and efficient. Thanks to computer science, nowadays they have extremely
                powerful Computer Aided Design (CAD) software that allows for sketched to be created quickly
                and shared instantly significantly reducing production time. In addition, new buildings are much
                safer thanks to the testing that can be conducted on building models in a virtual environment. “<i>In
                developing countries, poor quality construction has lead to spontaneous building collapse and,
                during earthquakes, to major disaster</i>”(2) Therefor this greatly benefits developing countries that
                may be frequent victims of natural disasters as buildings designed through this software are far less
                likely to collapse and be hazardous to those within its vicinity.

                Allowing computer science to change healthcare systems will greatly benefit a city. “<i>On average
                across these OECD countries, the median waiting times for more minor surgery like cataract
                operation was 95 days in 2018, and longer for more major surgery like hip replacement (110 days)
                and knee replacement (140 days).</i>” (3) With most current healthcare systems on their knees it is
                crucial that we allow computer science to make changes. Creating new databases and information
                storage systems will lead to shorter waiting times, better accessibility for the less fortunate and
                overall better safety for all. With the use of robotically assisted surgeries, diagnostics and
                treatments, healthcare workers who are overrun with work will be able to work more efficiently and
                with much less stress. This results in a better workplace environment, making a job in healthcare far
                more appealing to young people which further reduces staff shortages and stress on a city’s
                healthcare system.

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <h3>Social media can influence people to put themselves out there and display their talents or knowledge for
            others to see. It can be used as a way of making a living If someone decides to go down the path of content
            creating, streaming, competitive gaming etc. Social media can make their brands more widely available which
            can result in a steady gain of viewership, it gives people the opportunity to chase their dreams and grants
            them a chance to gain something from their journeys.

        <h3>Opportunities:</h3>
        <p>While some may not dwell upon the opportunities social media may grant them, due to the exponential growth of
            users getting access to social media it can be seen as an effective route for getting your name out there
            especially if you are a business. (3) “Social media platforms have varying advantages, but for any business,
            it is essential to use them for digital marketing, customer support, gathering data, and more. Additionally,
            it is a simple and low-risk way for your company to reach new audiences who may be interested in your brand
            and services.”

        <p>
            It can be a reliable source of gathering information for what is currently taking place in your area or the
            world. There is no other place that spreads more information rapidly than social media, thus making it a top
            source of information. (4) “Different media inform us about what is happening in the country and in the
            world. This information helps us to be in touch with reality and to understand what is happening around us
            and, of course, to understand what is happening to the other.” Despite it making people aware of what is currently happening in their frame of reference, it
            allows for people to dig deeper into situations and do extensive research for them. While this may not seem
            too important, it can help to paint the bigger picture of certain events or highlight potential oversights
            others may have had.

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>
            In short, social media is a reliable way to connect communities with one another allowing for growth and
            comfort. It may have disadvantages to it, but these can easily be avoided if cautious. It is a terrific way
            of growing your brand and can act as a reliable source of information for people to take advantage of. Some
            may not be interested in social media or fear the effects it has on people’s lives; despite that it is a
            leading factor to the development of communities and one of the easiest ways to spread word of them.
